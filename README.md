## Description

This portfolio website showcases my Front End Web Development skillset with recent work, upcoming projects and the site itself. So far, it is able to demonstrate my competency in writing HTML and CSS to develop a functioning webpage for a potential employer to view. It also highlights my understanding of the processes involved in maintaining a GitHub repository and contributing to projects from a local repo, significant for working as part of a team.

This particular portfolio site required the use of flex and grid displays to style the site layout and be responsive to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports. As my very first independently built website, there were many challenges that I overcame. From the basic CSS box model in action to the application of media queries for differing viewports, I am proud to have a better grasp of working out the solutions in the end.

You will notice only one piece of work is live in my portfolio. The others will open the portfolio again in a new tab. I intend to update these as future work is completed, while also updating features of the portfolio site itself to further demonstrate my progress and commitment to showcasing my growing Front End Web Development skills.
